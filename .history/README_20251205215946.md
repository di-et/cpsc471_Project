# File Transfer Server

A lightweight file-transfer server and client that communicate over TCP and supports four basic commands:

* **ls** - List files on the server
* **GET <filename>** - Download a file from the server
* **PUT <filename>** - Upload a file to the server
* **EXIT** - Close the connection

This project is intended as a minimal demonstration of socket programming and custom application-level protocols.


## Features

### LS

Returns a newline-separated list of files in the server’s directory.

### GET <filename>

Sends the requested file to the client.
The server responds with either:

* The contents of the requested file.
* An error message if the file does not exist.

### PUT <filename>

Allows the client to upload a file to the 
server.
The client sends the filename and data, and the server saves it to disk.

### EXIT

Disconnects the client.
The server keeps running and can accept new connections.


## Starting the Server

After downloading the server C++ file, compile it using the compiler of your choice.

Example:
```bash
g++ cpsc471_Network_project_prt2.cpp -o startserver.out
```

After compiling, start the server by running the program file with the following arguments: IP address and port number. To start the server locally, do the following

```bash
./startserver.out 127.0.0.1 8080
```

## Connecting to the Server 

**REQUIREMENTS:**

A computer networking utility is required to connect to the server. *netcat* is recommended, as connection is simple, and following examples will use it. 

Example:

```bash
nc <SERVER_IP> <PORT_NUMBER>
```

Once connected, you can type commands interactively:

Example Syntax:

```
ls

GET <filename>

PUT <filename>

EXIT
```

## Error Handling

The server returns clear responses when something goes wrong:

* `ERROR: File not found: <filename>`
* `Invalid command.`
* `ERROR: Cannot create file: <filename>`
